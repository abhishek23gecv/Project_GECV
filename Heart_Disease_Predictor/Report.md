## 📌 Project Overview  
This mini project focuses on predicting the possibility of heart disease using patient health data.  
It was developed as part of a seminar to show how **smart data-driven systems** can support healthcare and help build a healthier, connected society.

The project uses basic machine learning concepts to analyze medical parameters and provide a prediction that can assist in early health awareness.

---

## 🎯 Objective  
The main objectives of this project are:
- To analyze health-related data
- To predict the risk of heart disease
- To demonstrate the role of smart technologies in healthcare
- To support preventive care through early prediction

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement  
Heart disease is one of the major health issues worldwide.  
Many cases can be prevented if risks are identified early.  
Traditional diagnosis can be time-consuming and not always easily accessible.

This project aims to show how a simple predictive system can help in identifying heart disease risk at an early stage.

---

## 💡 Solution Approach  
The solution is implemented using a machine learning model that:
1. Takes patient health parameters as input  
2. Processes the data using a trained model  
3. Predicts whether a person is likely to have heart disease  

This approach highlights how smart computing can assist medical decision-making.
